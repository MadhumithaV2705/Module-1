# Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Minimum of Three Numbers

## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the minimum between three integer numbers using a conditional expression (Ternary operator).

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.
2. Read two floating-point numbers from the user and store them in `num1` and `num2`.
3. Compare `num1` and `num2` using a conditional expression to find the smaller value and store it in `min_num`.
4. Display the minimum value using the `print()` function.
5. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No- 212223060145
# Name- Madhumitha V
num1=float(input())
num2=float(input())

min_num = num1 if num1<num2 else num2

print(f"The minimum of {num1} and {num2} is {min_num}")
```

## RESULT
Thus a Python program to find the minimum between three integer numbers using a conditional expression has been implemented and executed successfully.
