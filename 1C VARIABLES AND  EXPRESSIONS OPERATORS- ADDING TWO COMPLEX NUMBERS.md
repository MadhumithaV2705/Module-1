# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators - Adding Two Complex Numbers

## AIM
To create a Python program that reads two integers, forms a complex number, and displays its real and imaginary parts.

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Read two integer inputs `a` and `b` from the user and create a complex number `x = complex(a, b)`.
3. Display the complex number `x`, its real part `x.real`, and its imaginary part `x.imag` using `print()`.
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No- 212223060145
#Name- Madhumitha V
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
x = complex(a, b)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```
